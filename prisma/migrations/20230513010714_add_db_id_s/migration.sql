/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Role` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Role` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `UserRole` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The required column `uuid` was added to the `User` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `UserRole` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `roleId` on the `UserRole` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
