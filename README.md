# CSGO Nade Application

This appliaction is meant for DOT members to remeber strats on different maps
and to help them remeber lineups.

The app has a set of maps with a set of starts. Each start has spesific nades
with a "owner". The "owner" is the person who is supposed to throw the smoke
if that start goes as planned.

Currently you are not able to add new maps, strats or nade.
This can be implemented in later versions.
