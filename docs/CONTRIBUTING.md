## 📝 Making changes to the codebase

1. Every change should be related to an issue. If the issue doesn't exist, create one before starting to work on the implementation.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Create a branch based on `main` with a name following the [branch naming convention](#branch-naming) for this repository.
4. Implement the issue in your branch.
5. When finished, create a pull request to `main`.
6. Assign it with an appropriate label based on the work you have implemented.
7. Wait for comments/approval:
   - If it is approved, you don't have to do anything more.
   - If it's not approved, review the comments and fix the problems. Then wait for another approval.

## 🌿 Branching standards for the repo

<h3 id="branch-naming">Branch Naming Convention</h3>

Start with the issue number followed by a short title describing what you are working on in the branch.

Example:

```
76-write-contribution-guide
```

### Short-lived Branches

Branches should be short-lived, making it easier to merge them into production. If the branch is long-lived, the issue you are working on is probably too big and should be split into smaller issues that can be completed faster.
